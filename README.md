# Preprocessing and analysis for the DENDROHIST project

## Introduction
The need for the functions in this package arose while processing datasets from the DENDROHIST project (PID2021-126411OB-I00, Ministerio de Cienca e Innovación de España, www.creaf.cat/long-term-perspective-current-enviornmental-crisis-iberian-mediterranean-region-dendrochronological-and-historical-archives), whose IP is Dr. Laia Andreu Hayles (www.creaf.cat/staff/laia-andreu-hayles) from CREAF (www.creaf.cat).

The tasks for which functions in this package are suited are the following:
1. Processing of time series of rain data from Spanish meteorological stations.
2. Checking of internal coherence of the historical flood database.

## Datasets
Datasets that are employed within the context of this project have different origins.


## Processing of precipitation time series
Precipitation time series include daily and monthly datasets from a sets of meteorological stations across the Spanish mainland and the Balearic islands (the Canary Islands have been excluded for the time being).

## Checking of historical flood database
