# Preprocessing and analysis for the DENDROHIST project

## Introduction
The need for the functions in this package arose while processing datasets from the DENDROHIST project (PID2021-126411OB-I00, Ministerio de Cienca e Innovación de España, www.creaf.cat/long-term-perspective-current-enviornmental-crisis-iberian-mediterranean-region-dendrochronological-and-historical-archives), whose IP is Dr. Laia Andreu Hayles (www.creaf.cat/staff/laia-andreu-hayles) from CREAF (www.creaf.cat).
The objectives of the project are the following (see URL of the project above):

> *"DENDROHIST aims to provide long-term critical climate information for the Iberian Mediterranean region using tree-ring and historical records. The integration of these two independent paleoclimate archives will  allow for a multidisciplinary approach to estimate the full range of past climate variability at different temporal and spatial scales, as well as the detailed occurrence and recurrence frequencies of extreme climate events."*

These objectives imply the acquisition, preprocessing and analyses of different datasets from varying origins. With those purposes in mind we have set out to design and implement a series of functions, written in R and collected into a so-called R package, that can be simplify the tasks ahead. 
The tasks for which functions in this package are suited are the following:
1. Processing of time series of rain data from Spanish meteorological stations.
2. Checking of internal coherence of the historical flood database.

These two tasks are certainly related. 

## Datasets
Datasets that are employed within the context of this project have different origins.


## Processing of precipitation time series
Precipitation time series include daily and monthly datasets from a sets of meteorological stations across the Spanish mainland and the Balearic islands (the Canary Islands have been excluded for the time being). Those time series usually cover *** years, although that coverage vary from site to site.

## Checking of historical flood database
A great deal of work during the past years has been devoted to collecting catastrophic flood data from public and private records at local, county, province or regional level.
